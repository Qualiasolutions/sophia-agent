# Sophia AI Agent Commands

This directory contains specialized AI agents for the Sophia WhatsApp AI project. Each agent is an expert in a specific domain and can help you complete tasks efficiently.

## Quick Start

### Main Orchestrator (Start Here!)
```bash
/sophia
```
The orchestrator analyzes your project state and recommends the best next action. It delegates work to specialized agents automatically.

- `/sophia-story continue` - Resume current story
- `/sophia-story test` - Run test suite
- `/sophia-story review` - Prepare for review
- `/sophia-story status` - Show progress

**Example:**
```bash
/sophia-story start 2.1  # Start Epic 2, Story 1 (Document Generation)

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Complete Story 1.6
```bash
# Orchestrator recommends next action
/sophia next

# Execute story tasks
/sophia-story continue

# Run tests
/sophia-test run

# Deploy to staging
/sophia-deploy staging

# Deploy to production
/sophia-deploy production
```

### Example 2: Start Epic 2 (Document Generation)
```bash
# Check project status
/sophia status

# Design the database schema
/sophia-db migrate document_templates
/sophia-db migrate document_generations

# Design AI conversation flow
/sophia-ai design document-generation

# Start implementing the story
/sophia-story start 2.1

# Write comprehensive tests
/sophia-test write document-generation

# Deploy when ready
/sophia-deploy production
```

### Example 3: Optimize WhatsApp Performance
```bash
# Check WhatsApp metrics
/sophia-whatsapp monitor

# Optimize delivery
/sophia-whatsapp optimize

# Test improvements
/sophia-test performance

# Deploy optimizations
/sophia-deploy staging
```

## Agent Coordination

The orchestrator (`/sophia`) can coordinate multiple agents:

```bash
# Orchestrator analyzes and delegates
/sophia plan epic-2

# Might delegate to:
# - /sophia-db for schema
# - /sophia-ai for conversation design
# - /sophia-story for implementation
# - /sophia-test for quality
# - /sophia-deploy for production
```

## Tips for Using Agents

1. **Start with the orchestrator** (`/sophia`) - It analyzes your situation and recommends the best agent
2. **One task at a time** - Each agent is focused on its specialty
3. **Follow BMAD methodology** - Agents understand the story-driven workflow
4. **Test before deploying** - Always use `/sophia-test` before `/sophia-deploy`
5. **Check status frequently** - Use `/sophia status` to track progress

## Current Project State

As of Story 1.6:
- ‚úÖ Epic 1 (Core WhatsApp Integration) - 95% complete
- ‚è≥ Manual testing needed for Story 1.6
- üéØ Next: Complete Story 1.6, then start Epic 2 (Document Generation)

## Getting Help

Each agent provides context-aware help. Just run the agent command to see:
- Current status in its domain
- Available commands
- Recommendations for next actions

**Start here:**
```bash
/sophia
```

The orchestrator will guide you!
