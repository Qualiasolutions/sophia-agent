Thus as: 99 ** 67 32

If [link] from the bank is not available for some reason. Then the agent should provide the Registration Details i.e Reg No. 0/1678 Tala, Paphos OR alternatively, worst case scenario the description of the property => i.e. Limas Building, Unit No. 103 Tala, Paphos

[bank name i.e Gordian Team, Altia Team etc..] = If a link is provided then no need to ask who is the bank in the Dear.. since is visible on the link.. but if for some reason is not visible in the link name or the agnet didn't mention it once he sends the instructions to Sohpia then Sophia should ask them.

Please find attached the viewing form for the below Land. = It has to have a viewing form attached. So Sophia would just remind them once she sends the registration text to them that they should don't forget to attach the viewing form in in the email while sending the registration for Land..

The reason is because banks sales persons don't attend to viewings in the bank and thus cannot confirm the registration has been taken place thus they ask for the viewing form.
