Dear {{CLIENT_NAME}},

I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to follow up with you and see if you are still in the market for a {{PROPERTY_TYPE}} in {{PROPERTY_LOCATION}}. I have a new property option that may fit your requirements, and I would be happy to share it with you.

Here it is:
{{PROPERTY_LINK}}

Please let me know if the above property catches your attention or if there are any updates to your property preferences or budget. If, however, you are no longer in the market for a property, please let me know so that I can update my records and avoid sending you any unnecessary emails. Your satisfaction is important to me.

Thank you for your time, and I look forward to hearing back from you soon.
