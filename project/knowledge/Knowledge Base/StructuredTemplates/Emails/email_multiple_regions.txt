Subject: Adjustments required for areas of interest â€“ {{CLIENT_NAME}}

Dear {{CLIENT_NAME}},

We hope this email finds you well. We appreciate your interest in our estate agency and your request to view properties in different areas in {{CITY_OR_REGION}}.

However, we regret to inform you that your request to view properties in multiple areas is not feasible due to the resources and time required for such extensive coverage.

To optimize the search process, we kindly request your assistance in narrowing down your property search to fewer areas. As you may know, {{CITY_OR_REGION}} offers a wide range of diverse neighborhoods and locations. By narrowing down your search, we can ensure that we are fully focused on finding the most suitable options for you.

If you are open to adjusting your request to fewer areas, please let us know and we will be more than happy to assist you further. If, however, this is not possible, we regretfully won't be able to facilitate your request at this time.

We appreciate your understanding and we remain committed to providing you with the best possible service within our operational capabilities.

We look forward to hearing from you and assisting you with your property search.
