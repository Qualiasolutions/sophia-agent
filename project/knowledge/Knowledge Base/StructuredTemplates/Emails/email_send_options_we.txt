Dear {{CLIENT_NAME}},

We hope this email finds you well. We wanted to follow up with you and see if you are still in the market for a property in {{SEARCH_LOCATION}}. We have some new property options that may fit your requirements, and we would be happy to share them with you.

Please let us know if any of these properties catch your attention or if there are any updates to your property preferences or budget. If, however, you are no longer in the market for a property, please let us know so that we can update our records and avoid sending you any unnecessary emails. Your satisfaction is important to us.

Thank you for your time, and we look forward to hearing back from you soon.
