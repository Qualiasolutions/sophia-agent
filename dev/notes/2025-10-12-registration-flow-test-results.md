## Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Standard Seller Registration Flow
**Expected Behavior:**
1. User says "I need a registration"
2. Sophia asks: "What type of registration: Seller, Developer, or Bank?"
3. User says "Seller"
4. Sophia asks: "Which seller registration: (1) Standard, (2) Marketing Agreement, (3) Advanced, or (4) Rental?"
5. User says "Standard"
6. Sophia checks for multiple sellers
7. Sophia collects missing fields (name, phone, email, address, value)
8. Sophia generates document immediately when all fields collected
9. Document sent as exact replica with "Dear XXXXXXXX," placeholder

**Test Results:**
- Status: ⏳ PENDING (Requires live WhatsApp interaction)
- Notes: Previous conversation shows user waiting for document

### Scenario 2: Smart Field Extraction
**Expected Behavior:**
1. User says "I need a standard seller registration for Fawzi at 99111668, fawzi@example.com, property at Karpathou 11 worth €56,000"
2. Sophia extracts all fields automatically
3. Sophia confirms registration type
4. Sophia generates immediately without asking for already-provided information

**Test Results:**
- Status: ⏳ PENDING (Requires live WhatsApp interaction)
- Notes: Field extraction logic implemented in document-optimized.service.ts:683-722

### Scenario 3: Bank Registration Flow
**Expected Behavior:**
1. User says "I need a bank registration"
2. Sophia asks: "Is this for property or land registration?"
3. User says "Property"
4. Sophia selects bank_property_registration template
5. Sophia collects required fields
6. Document generated with correct format

**Test Results:**
- Status: ⏳ PENDING (Requires live WhatsApp interaction)

### Scenario 4: Developer Registration with Viewing
**Expected Behavior:**
1. User says "I need a developer registration"
2. Sophia asks: "Is a viewing arranged?"
3. User says "Yes"
4. Sophia selects developer_viewing_arranged template
5. Document includes viewing form fields

**Test Results:**
- Status: ⏳ PENDING (Requires live WhatsApp interaction)

### Scenario 5: Multiple Sellers Clause
**Expected Behavior:**
1. During any registration flow, when asked about multiple sellers
2. User says "Yes" or "Multiple sellers"
3. Sophia includes multiple_sellers_clause (template 09)
4. Document includes co-ownership language

**Test Results:**
- Status: ⏳ PENDING (Requires live WhatsApp interaction)

## Technical Validation

### Code Quality
- ✅ All TypeScript strict mode errors resolved
- ✅ No compilation warnings
- ✅ Proper error handling implemented
- ✅ Type safety maintained throughout

### Template System
- ✅ 11 registration templates created
- ✅ Template intent classifier mapping updated
- ✅ Smart field extraction implemented
- ✅ Phone masking function added (99 ** 67 32 format)

### Service Layer
- ✅ `template-intent.service.ts` - Maps user intents to templates
- ✅ `document-optimized.service.ts` - Intelligent pipeline with field extraction
- ✅ `openai.service.ts` - 3-step flow system prompt updated
- ✅ `template-instructions.service.ts` - Provides micro-instructions
- ✅ `template-cache.service.ts` - Performance optimization

### API Routes
- ✅ `whatsapp-webhook/route.ts` - Smart routing to optimized service
- ✅ Health endpoint responding correctly
- ✅ Error handling in place

## Performance Expectations
- **Response Time**: <2s for simple requests, <5s for document generation
- **Caching**: Template cache service reduces repeated lookups
- **Token Optimization**: Smart field extraction reduces API calls

## Known Issues from Previous Session
1. ❌ User frustration: "I'm tired of waiting"
   - **Root Cause**: Old flow was asking too many confirmation questions
   - **Fix Applied**: New flow generates immediately when all fields collected
   - **Status**: Deployed, awaiting real-world validation

2. ❌ Document not generating
   - **Root Cause**: Missing field validation was too strict
   - **Fix Applied**: Smart field extraction from previous messages
   - **Status**: Deployed, awaiting real-world validation

## Next Steps for Live Testing

### Immediate Testing Needed
1. **Monitor Active Conversation**: Agent Four has pending registration request
2. **Test New Flow**: Send test message to verify 3-step flow works
3. **Verify Documents**: Check generated documents match template format exactly
4. **Field Extraction**: Verify smart extraction from conversational messages
5. **Performance**: Measure actual response times in production

### Test Commands
```bash
# Monitor recent logs
node dev/scripts/check-recent-logs.mjs

# Check specific agent
node dev/scripts/check-agent.mjs

# Monitor Vercel logs
vercel logs https://sophia-agent.vercel.app

# Health check
curl https://sophia-agent.vercel.app/api/health
```

### Success Criteria
- ✅ User completes registration in <3 minutes
- ✅ Documents match template format exactly
- ✅ No unnecessary confirmation questions
- ✅ Smart field extraction works for common patterns
- ✅ Phone numbers properly masked
- ✅ Subject line sent separately
- ✅ "Dear XXXXXXXX," placeholder used correctly

## Monitoring Recommendations
1. Watch conversation_logs for new registration requests
2. Monitor document_request_sessions table for completion rates
3. Track flow_performance_events for drop-off points
4. Review openai_usage_stats for token efficiency
5. Check template_cache hit rates

## Rollback Plan
If critical issues discovered:
```bash
git revert HEAD
git push origin main
# Vercel will auto-deploy previous working version
```

## Conclusion
All code changes successfully deployed to production. TypeScript compilation clean. Health checks passing. System ready for live testing with real WhatsApp interactions.

**Status**: ✅ DEPLOYMENT SUCCESSFUL - READY FOR USER TESTING
