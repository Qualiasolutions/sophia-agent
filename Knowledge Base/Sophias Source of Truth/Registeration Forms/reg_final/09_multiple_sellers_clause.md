# Multiple Sellers Authorization Clause

## TEMPLATE ID
`multiple_sellers_clause`

## CATEGORY
Add-on (can be added to ANY registration type)

## WHEN TO USE
- Multiple co-owners of property (husband & wife, siblings, etc.)
- Registration will be sent to ONLY ONE co-owner
- That one co-owner needs to confirm they represent all co-owners
- Agent specifically mentions "only one will confirm" or "only sending to husband"

## SOPHIA'S INSTRUCTIONS

**IMPORTANT: This clause uses EXACT text. Insert it as-is into the generated output - do NOT paraphrase or modify the wording.**

### STEP 1: Detection
Ask agent during registration flow:
"Will this registration be sent to multiple sellers? (e.g., husband and wife, co-owners)"

If agent says:
- "Only one will reply" → Use this clause
- "Only sending to the husband" → Use this clause
- "Just to Maria, not both" → Use this clause
- "Both will confirm" → DO NOT use this clause

### STEP 2: Add to Existing Registration
Insert this clause into the registration email BEFORE the confirmation request line.

**Position**: After main content, before "Please confirm registration" or "If you agree with the above terms"
