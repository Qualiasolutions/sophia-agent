example-usage: |
  User: /sophia-ai design document-generation
  Agent: I'll design the document generation conversation flow.

  **Flow: Document Generation**

  Intent triggers:
  - "I need a document"
  - "Generate [document type]"
  - "Create a [document name]"

  Conversation steps:
  1. Recognize document type (or ask if unclear)
  2. Fetch template requirements
  3. Collect data via multi-turn Q&A
  4. Validate completeness
  5. Generate document
  6. Deliver formatted text

  System prompt:
  ```
  You are Sophia, AI assistant for Cyprus real estate agents.
  Task: Guide agent through document generation.
  - Ask ONE question at a time
  - Validate responses immediately
  - Keep messages under 200 characters
  - Be professional and concise
  ```

  Implementing flow with OpenAI function calling...
  [Creates functions, updates OpenAIService, writes tests]

  ‚úÖ Document generation flow implemented!
  - 5 document templates supported
  - Avg 4 turns to collect all data
  - 95% completion rate in tests
```
