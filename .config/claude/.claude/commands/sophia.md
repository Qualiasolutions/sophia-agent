example-usage: |
  User: /sophia status
  Agent: **Sophia AI Project Status**

  üìä **Current State:**
  - Story: 1.6 (End-to-End Conversation Flow)
  - Status: Ready for Review
  - Epic: 1 (Core WhatsApp Integration) - 95% complete

  ‚úÖ **Completed:**
  - Stories 1.1-1.5 (100%)
  - Database schema (agents, conversation_logs)
  - WhatsApp integration (Twilio)
  - OpenAI integration (GPT)
  - Automated tests (82% coverage)

  ‚è≥ **Current Work:**
  - Story 1.6: Manual testing needed
  - Test with real WhatsApp agents
  - Verify 5-second response time
  - Check concurrent conversations (5 agents)

  üéØ **Next Steps:**
  1. Complete Story 1.6 manual testing ‚Üí Use /sophia-story test
  2. Deploy to production ‚Üí Use /sophia-deploy production
  3. Start Epic 2 (Document Generation) ‚Üí Use /sophia-story start 2.1

  üöß **Blockers:**
  None identified

  üí° **Recommendation:**
  Run `/sophia-story continue` to complete Story 1.6 manual testing,
  then `/sophia-deploy staging` to prepare for production.

  ---

  User: /sophia next
  Agent: Based on current state, here's the optimal next action:

  **Recommended: Complete Story 1.6 Manual Testing**

  Why: Story 1.6 is 95% complete, just needs manual testing with real agents.

  **Action Plan:**
  1. Use `/sophia-story continue` to:
     - Set up test agents in Supabase
     - Send test messages from WhatsApp
     - Verify greeting responses
     - Test concurrent conversations
     - Validate performance (<5s)

  2. After tests pass, use `/sophia-deploy staging` to:
     - Deploy to staging environment
     - Run smoke tests
     - Prepare for production

  3. Once staging verified, use `/sophia-deploy production`

  **Estimated time:** 1-2 hours
  **Risk:** Low (tests already passing, just needs manual verification)

  Would you like me to start with `/sophia-story continue`?
```
