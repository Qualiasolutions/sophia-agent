# Sophia Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

### Goals

- Enable Cyprus real estate agents to generate pre-filled documents instantly via WhatsApp conversation, eliminating manual form filling
- Automate property listing uploads to zyprus.com through conversational interface, reducing desktop dependency and time-to-publish
- Provide on-demand real estate calculations (mortgage, ROI, commission) through simple WhatsApp messages without manual calculator navigation
- Increase agent productivity by 30% through reduction of administrative task overhead
- Achieve mobile-first workflow automation that allows agents to complete tasks from anywhere in the field
- Deliver 60% adoption rate among zyprus.com agents within 3 months by leveraging familiar WhatsApp interface

**MVP Success Criteria:** As defined in the Project Brief (docs/brief.md), the MVP will be validated against technical viability (50+ concurrent conversations, <2 min response times, 99% uptime), feature adoption (40% of beta agents complete all three core workflows within first month), user validation (70%+ satisfaction score), business value (3+ hours saved per agent per week), and quality baseline (85%+ listing upload success rate).

### Background Context

Sophia addresses critical productivity barriers facing Cyprus real estate agents at zyprus.com who spend substantial portions of their workday on manual administrative tasks—document preparation, listing management, and calculations. These inefficiencies result in lost time for client interactions, mobile friction for field-based work, and delayed responsiveness to market opportunities.

The competitive Cyprus real estate market demands faster response times, quicker listing publication, and more time spent with clients. Existing solutions fall short by requiring desktop access, lacking conversational interfaces, and failing to integrate with zyprus.com infrastructure. Sophia solves this by meeting agents where they already are (WhatsApp) with an AI-powered assistant that consolidates document generation, listing upload, and calculations in a single mobile-first conversational interface.

**Implementation:** Automated cleanup jobs scheduled to run daily, removing records older than retention period. User deletion requests processed within 30 days as required by GDPR.

## User Interface Design Goals

### Overall UX Vision

Sophia's user experience is built on **zero-friction conversational interaction** that meets agents in their existing communication workflows. The primary interface is natural language conversation through WhatsApp and Telegram—no custom UI to learn, no app downloads, no training required. Agents interact with Sophia exactly as they would with a human assistant, using familiar messaging patterns. The UX philosophy is "invisible interface"—the technology disappears, leaving only helpful, responsive assistance.

For administrative functions (monitoring, configuration, analytics), a lightweight web dashboard provides visibility and control without requiring daily interaction.

### Key Interaction Paradigms

**Conversational First:**
- All agent-facing interactions happen through natural language messaging
- Sophia guides multi-turn conversations with clear prompts and confirmation steps
- Agents can interrupt, ask clarifying questions, or abandon tasks naturally
- Responses are concise, mobile-friendly text formatted for easy reading on phones

**Progressive Disclosure:**
- Simple requests (calculations, document generation) complete in 1-3 messages
- Complex workflows (listing creation) break down into manageable steps with clear progress indicators
- Sophia provides examples and suggestions when agents seem uncertain

**Intelligent Defaults and Memory:**
- Sophia remembers context within conversations (e.g., property details provided earlier)
- Common patterns are learned and suggested (frequent document types, typical property configurations)
- Error recovery is graceful with helpful suggestions rather than technical error messages

**Admin Dashboard (Secondary Interface):**
- Clean, minimal web interface for system monitoring and configuration
- Real-time conversation activity visibility
- Template management and configuration tools
- Analytics and usage reporting

### Core Screens and Views

**Agent-Facing (Conversational - WhatsApp/Telegram):**
- Chat conversation interface (provided by WhatsApp/Telegram - no custom development)
- Message formatting: Plain text responses with occasional structured formatting (bullet lists, numbered options)

**Administrative (Web Dashboard):**
- Login/Authentication Screen
- Dashboard Overview (system health, active conversations, recent activity)
- Agent Management (view registered agents, authentication status)
- Template Library Management (view, edit, create document templates)
- Conversation Logs & Analytics (search/filter past interactions, usage metrics)
- System Configuration (email settings, API keys, feature toggles)
- Monitoring & Alerts (error logs, performance metrics, uptime status)

### Accessibility

**Accessibility Requirements:** WCAG AA compliance for web-based admin dashboard only (conversational interfaces inherit WhatsApp/Telegram native accessibility features).

**Considerations:**
- Admin dashboard must support screen readers
- Keyboard navigation for all dashboard functions
- Sufficient color contrast for text and interactive elements
- Text resizing without loss of functionality

**Note:** WhatsApp and Telegram provide native accessibility features (VoiceOver, TalkBack support) that Sophia inherits automatically for agent-facing interactions.

### Branding

**Sophia Brand Identity:**
- Friendly, professional, competent tone in all conversational responses
- Consistent "voice" that reflects helpfulness without being overly casual or robotic
- Profile image for WhatsApp/Telegram: Professional avatar representing "Sophia" identity

**Admin Dashboard Branding:**
- Clean, modern interface aligned with zyprus.com visual identity (if brand guidelines exist)
- Neutral color palette prioritizing readability and usability over decorative design
- zyprus.com logo and branding elements incorporated into dashboard header/footer

**No specific style guide provided—design should prioritize function over form with professional, trustworthy aesthetic.**

### Target Device and Platforms

**Primary Target:** Mobile devices (iOS and Android smartphones) via WhatsApp and Telegram native apps - Web Responsive not applicable as agents use native messaging apps.

**Secondary Target:** Desktop/laptop web browsers for admin dashboard (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - latest 2 versions) - Responsive design for tablet and desktop viewing.

**Platform Breakdown:**
- **Agent Interface:** WhatsApp (iOS/Android), Telegram (iOS/Android, desktop client)
- **Admin Interface:** Web-based responsive dashboard accessible from desktop, laptop, and tablet devices

## Technical Assumptions

### Repository Structure

**Monorepo** - Single Next.js repository containing all API routes (serverless functions), admin dashboard frontend, and shared libraries for common utilities, authentication, and logging.

**Rationale:** With serverless architecture on Vercel and a small-to-medium scale (100 agents), a Next.js monorepo provides the simplest development experience. All API routes live alongside the admin dashboard, shared TypeScript types are easily accessible, and deployment is a single command. This approach eliminates the complexity of managing multiple repositories and container orchestration while maintaining clear separation of concerns through folder structure.

### Service Architecture

**Serverless Functions (Vercel) + Backend-as-a-Service (Supabase)** - API routes as serverless functions with Supabase providing database, auth, and storage.

**Core API Routes (Vercel Serverless Functions):**
- **/api/whatsapp-webhook** - Handles Meta WhatsApp Business API webhooks, message processing
- **/api/telegram-webhook** - Manages Telegram Bot API webhooks and message routing
- **/api/conversation** - Orchestrates conversation flows, AI intent recognition, workflow routing
- **/api/documents** - Document generation using templates with variable substitution
- **/api/listings** - Property listing workflow and zyprus.com API integration
- **/api/email** - Gmail API integration for sophia@zyprus.com email management
- **/api/calculator** - Real estate calculation endpoints (mortgage, ROI, commission)
- **/api/admin/\*** - Admin dashboard backend APIs (agent management, analytics, logs)

**Supabase Services:**
- **PostgreSQL Database** - Agent profiles, conversation logs, document templates, listing data
- **Supabase Auth** - Agent authentication and authorization
- **Supabase Storage** - Document template storage (if files needed)
- **Row Level Security (RLS)** - Database-level security policies

**State Management:**
- **Upstash Redis (Serverless)** - Conversation state caching, session management (500K commands/month free tier)
- **Alternative:** Vercel KV if Redis integration proves unnecessary

**Rationale:** Serverless architecture eliminates infrastructure management, scales automatically with demand, and aligns with cost optimization goals. Supabase provides production-ready database, auth, and storage without managing servers. This stack enables rapid development with near-zero operational overhead and costs significantly less than traditional cloud infrastructure (~$45/month vs $150+/month for AWS equivalent).

### Testing Requirements

**Unit + Integration Testing** - Comprehensive test coverage for business logic and external integrations.

**Testing Strategy:**
- **Unit Tests:** Core business logic (template rendering, calculation algorithms, conversation state management) using Jest
- **Integration Tests:** API route testing with mocked external services (WhatsApp, Telegram, Gmail), Supabase database operations
- **API Contract Tests:** Validate external API integrations (WhatsApp, Telegram, zyprus.com) with test accounts
- **End-to-End Tests:** Critical workflows (document generation, listing upload) using Playwright or Cypress to simulate complete user journeys
- **Manual Testing:** Conversational AI quality, error handling edge cases, real WhatsApp/Telegram interaction testing

**CI/CD Integration:** GitHub Actions automated testing on every pull request, blocking merges on test failures, automatic deployment to Vercel on merge to main.

**Rationale:** Testing is essential for conversational AI reliability. Unit tests ensure logic correctness, integration tests validate external dependencies, and E2E tests provide confidence in real-world scenarios. Manual testing remains critical for conversation quality assessment that automated tests cannot fully capture.

**API Documentation:**
- **Internal API Documentation:** TypeScript types serve as API contracts
- **External API Documentation:** Swagger/OpenAPI spec for admin dashboard API (if third-party integrations needed)

**Scalability Considerations:**
- **Serverless Auto-Scaling:** Vercel automatically scales functions based on demand
- **Database Connection Pooling:** Supabase provides connection pooling (Supavisor) to handle concurrent connections efficiently
- **Conversation State TTL:** Redis keys expire after conversation timeout (configurable, e.g., 30 minutes inactivity)
- **Cold Start Mitigation:**
  - Use Vercel Edge Functions for critical paths (faster cold starts)
  - Implement periodic health check pings to keep functions warm during business hours
  - Optimize bundle size to reduce cold start time

**Cost Optimization:**
- **LLM Costs:** Use GPT-4o-mini for simple intents (document requests, calculations), GPT-4o only for complex conversations (listing creation)
- **Conversation Context Management:** Limit context window size, summarize long conversations to reduce token usage
- **Caching:** Cache frequent AI responses (e.g., common calculator results, document template suggestions) in Redis
- **Database Optimization:** Use Supabase indexes for frequent queries, implement pagination for logs/analytics
