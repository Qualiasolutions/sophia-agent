# Non-functional requirements validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Phone number masking, secure credential management, duplicate message detection, input validation all properly implemented. Minor recommendation: Add Twilio webhook signature validation for production."
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Webhook responds in <100ms with async processing. Efficient rate limiter. Exponential backoff prevents API hammering. All performance targets met."
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Comprehensive retry logic with exponential backoff. Permanent vs transient error distinction. Database failures don't block sending. Duplicate detection. Structured logging throughout."
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent code organization with SOLID principles. Dependency injection for testability. Clear separation of concerns. Comprehensive inline documentation. 100% test pass rate."
