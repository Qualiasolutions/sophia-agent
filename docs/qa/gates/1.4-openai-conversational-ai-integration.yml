  future:
    - action: "Consider input sanitization for prompt injection defense"
      priority: LOW
      refs: ["packages/services/src/openai.service.ts:68-141"]
      rationale: "Current implementation secure for trusted agents. Add defense before public exposure."

    - action: "Implement conversation history management"
      priority: MEDIUM
      refs: ["Story 1.5 integration task"]
      rationale: "Deferred to next story as planned. Already supported in API design."

    - action: "Add database analytics for token usage"
      priority: LOW
      refs: ["packages/services/src/openai.service.ts:122-130"]
      rationale: "Console logging sufficient initially. Add when analytics dashboard needed."

    - action: "Implement advanced intent classification"
      priority: MEDIUM
      refs: ["packages/services/src/openai.service.ts:148-156"]
      rationale: "Basic greeting detection sufficient for MVP. Extend when more intents needed."

review_notes: |
  This implementation demonstrates exceptional software engineering quality and can serve
  as a reference for future development. The code is clean, well-tested, properly typed,
  and production-ready. All acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with comprehensive
  test coverage. No blocking issues or technical debt identified.

  The developer showed excellent judgment in:
  - Choosing appropriate abstractions (service pattern, singleton)
  - Comprehensive error handling covering all failure modes
  - Cost optimization (gpt-4o-mini selection, token limits)
  - Performance optimization (timeout enforcement, response time tracking)
  - Test design (35 tests covering all scenarios)
  - Code organization (proper monorepo structure)

  This story is approved for Done status without reservations.
