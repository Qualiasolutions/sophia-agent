# 1. Introduction

## 1.1 Project Overview

**Sophia AI** is an intelligent WhatsApp assistant designed for Cyprus real estate agents at zyprus.com. The platform enables 100+ agents to:

- Generate real estate documents (rental agreements, sales contracts, listings)

- Access financial calculators (mortgage, ROI, commission)
- Manage emails with AI-powered composition and scheduling
- Receive 24/7 AI assistance in their workflow

## 1.2 Architecture Goals

- **Scalability**: Support 100 agents (MVP) → 500+ agents (future)
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime, < 2s webhook response time
- **Security**: GDPR compliant, encrypted data, row-level security
- **Developer Experience**: TypeScript end-to-end, clear patterns, comprehensive tests
- **Cost Efficiency**: ~$231/month MVP, scales to ~$1,519/month at 500 agents

## 1.3 Starter Template Reference

This architecture is built on:
- **Next.js 14+** App Router with TypeScript
- **Supabase** for database, auth, and storage
- **Vercel** for serverless deployment
- **tRPC** for end-to-end type-safe APIs
