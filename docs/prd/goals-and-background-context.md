# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable Cyprus real estate agents to generate pre-filled documents instantly via WhatsApp conversation, eliminating manual form filling
- Automate property listing uploads to zyprus.com through conversational interface, reducing desktop dependency and time-to-publish
- Provide on-demand real estate calculations (mortgage, ROI, commission) through simple WhatsApp messages without manual calculator navigation
- Increase agent productivity by 30% through reduction of administrative task overhead
- Achieve mobile-first workflow automation that allows agents to complete tasks from anywhere in the field
- Deliver 60% adoption rate among zyprus.com agents within 3 months by leveraging familiar WhatsApp interface

**MVP Success Criteria:** As defined in the Project Brief (docs/brief.md), the MVP will be validated against technical viability (50+ concurrent conversations, <2 min response times, 99% uptime), feature adoption (40% of beta agents complete all three core workflows within first month), user validation (70%+ satisfaction score), business value (3+ hours saved per agent per week), and quality baseline (85%+ listing upload success rate).

## Background Context

Sophia addresses critical productivity barriers facing Cyprus real estate agents at zyprus.com who spend substantial portions of their workday on manual administrative tasksâ€”document preparation, listing management, and calculations. These inefficiencies result in lost time for client interactions, mobile friction for field-based work, and delayed responsiveness to market opportunities.

The competitive Cyprus real estate market demands faster response times, quicker listing publication, and more time spent with clients. Existing solutions fall short by requiring desktop access, lacking conversational interfaces, and failing to integrate with zyprus.com infrastructure. Sophia solves this by meeting agents where they already are (WhatsApp) with an AI-powered assistant that consolidates document generation, listing upload, and calculations in a single mobile-first conversational interface.
