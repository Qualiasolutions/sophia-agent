## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

[Source: docs/stories/1.3.story.md#dev-agent-record]

- Twilio WhatsApp webhook implemented at `/apps/web/src/app/api/whatsapp-webhook/route.ts`
- `conversation_logs` table exists with columns: id, agent_id, message_text, direction, timestamp, message_id
- Webhook uses async processing pattern (`void processMessageAsync()`) to avoid blocking
- Messages logged to database with agent lookup by phone number
- Comprehensive error handling pattern established (always return 200 OK to prevent retries)
- All tests co-located in `__tests__` directories
- 28 tests passing across project

**Note**: Story 1.4 creates the AI response generation capability. Story 1.5 will integrate this with WhatsApp to send responses back to agents.

### Tech Stack

[Source: architecture/3-tech-stack.md]

- **AI/ML**: OpenAI API 4.x (GPT-4o-mini model)
- **Language**: TypeScript 5.x with strict mode
- **Testing**: Vitest 1.x
- **API Framework**: Next.js 14+ App Router (serverless functions on Vercel)

### External API Specification

[Source: architecture/7-external-apis.md#openai-api]

**OpenAI API**
- **Base URL**: `https://api.openai.com/v1`
- **Authentication**: Bearer token (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- **Rate Limits**: 10,000 requests/min (tier-based, varies by account)
- **Model**: `gpt-4o-mini` (cost-optimized, fast responses)
- **Use Cases**:
  - Intent classification (understanding what user wants)
  - Response generation (conversational replies)
  - Data extraction (parsing structured info from messages)
- **Implementation**: `packages/services/src/openai.service.ts`

**GPT-4o-mini Pricing (as of 2024):**

```

### Testing

[Source: architecture/16-testing-strategy.md]

**Test Framework**: Vitest 1.x

**Test Coverage Requirements**:
- Services: >80%
- Overall: >75%

**Test File Location**: Co-located with code in `__tests__` directories
- OpenAI service tests: `/packages/services/src/__tests__/openai.service.test.ts`

**Key Test Scenarios:**
- Response generation (valid input, AI returns text)
- Model configuration (uses gpt-4o-mini)
- Greeting detection (various greeting formats)
- Error handling (API failures, timeouts, rate limits)
- Fallback responses (graceful degradation)
- Token usage logging (extracts and logs correctly)
- Response time (completes within 3 seconds)

**Mocking OpenAI API:**
```typescript
import { vi } from 'vitest';
import OpenAI from 'openai';

// Mock OpenAI client
vi.mock('openai', () => ({
  default: vi.fn().mockImplementation(() => ({
    chat: {
      completions: {
        create: vi.fn().mockResolvedValue({
          choices: [{ message: { content: 'Mocked AI response' } }],
          usage: { prompt_tokens: 50, completion_tokens: 100, total_tokens: 150 }
        })
      }
    }
  }))
}));
```

**Example Test Pattern:**
```typescript
describe('OpenAIService', () => {
  let service: OpenAIService;

  beforeEach(() => {
    service = new OpenAIService();
  });

  it('should generate response for valid message', async () => {
    const response = await service.generateResponse('Hello Sophia');
    expect(response.text).toBeDefined();
    expect(response.text.length).toBeGreaterThan(0);
    expect(response.tokensUsed.total).toBeGreaterThan(0);
  });

  it('should use gpt-4o-mini model', () => {
    expect(service.config.model).toBe('gpt-4o-mini');
  });

  it('should detect greeting messages', async () => {
    const response = await service.generateResponse('Hi Sophia');
    expect(response.text).toContain('Sophia');
    expect(response.text.toLowerCase()).toMatch(/hello|hi|help/);
  });

  it('should handle API errors gracefully', async () => {
    // Mock API failure
    vi.spyOn(service['client'].chat.completions, 'create').mockRejectedValueOnce(new Error('API Error'));

    const response = await service.generateResponse('Test message');
    expect(response.text).toContain('trouble processing');
  });
});
```

### Technical Constraints

- **Response Time**: Must complete within 3 seconds for simple queries [Source: Epic AC8]
- **Model**: Must use `gpt-4o-mini` for cost optimization [Source: Epic AC3]
- **Token Limits**: Max 500 tokens per response to control costs
- **Temperature**: 0.7 for balanced creativity/consistency
- **Timeout**: 3 seconds max wait for API response
- **Rate Limits**: 10,000 requests/min (OpenAI tier-based, monitor in production)

### Security Considerations

- **API Key Protection**: `OPENAI_API_KEY` must never be exposed client-side or in logs
- **Environment Variables**: Use server-side environment variables only
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize user input before sending to OpenAI (prevent prompt injection)
- **Cost Monitoring**: Log token usage to prevent unexpected API costs
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement request throttling if needed (not required for 100 agents)

### Performance Considerations

- **Response Time**: Target <3 seconds for 95th percentile
- **Token Optimization**: Use concise system prompt to reduce input tokens
- **Caching**: Consider caching common responses (future enhancement)
- **Streaming**: Consider streaming responses for longer queries (future enhancement)
- **Model Selection**: gpt-4o-mini is 60% cheaper than gpt-4o with similar quality

### Cost Estimates

**GPT-4o-mini Pricing:**
- Input: $0.150 / 1M tokens
- Output: $0.600 / 1M tokens

**Estimated Usage (100 agents, 10 messages/day each):**
- Daily messages: 1,000
- Avg input tokens: 100 (system prompt + user message)
- Avg output tokens: 200 (AI response)
- Daily cost: ~$0.135
- Monthly cost: ~$4.05
- Annual cost: ~$49

**Cost per conversation:** ~$0.000135

### Future Enhancements (Not in this story)

- Context-aware responses (use conversation history from conversation_logs)
- Intent classification (detect document generation, listing, calculation, email requests)
- Multi-turn conversation support (maintain state across messages)
- Streaming responses for real-time experience
- Custom fine-tuned model for real estate domain
- Response caching for common queries

### Technical Debt Identified

**Current Debt: MINIMAL**

No significant technical debt identified. All noted items are planned future enhancements, not debt:

1. **Integration Testing Deferred** (Story explicitly defers to 1.5)
   - Integration with conversation_logs intentionally deferred
   - Appropriate for incremental delivery

2. **Advanced Intent Classification** (Noted as future enhancement)
   - Current greeting detection sufficient for AC5
   - Extensible design allows easy addition

3. **Input Sanitization** (Security hardening for future)
   - Current implementation secure for trusted agents
   - Consider prompt injection defenses before public exposure

4. **Database Analytics for Token Usage** (Optional enhancement)
   - Console logging sufficient for initial monitoring
   - Can add database logging when analytics needed
